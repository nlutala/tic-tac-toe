# tic-tac-toe
A tic-tac-toe game using JavaFX

## Description
This program was created as a small project to help me familiarise myself with creating a game using a GUI 

### Getting Started

#### Dependencies
* Please ensure that you have an SDK (11 or higher) installed on your computer.
* Please ensure you have a text editor that is compatible with Java 8 (or higher)

#### Installing
* Open https://github.com/nlutala/tic-tac-toe in a new tab.
* Press the green code button and press "Download ZIP". (I have included IntelliJ files, however you can delete all ".ctxt" and ".class" files if you use another text editor).

#### Executing program
* Once you have downloaded the program, you can open it with a suitable text editor of your choice.
* Create and run a Home object.
